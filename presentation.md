# Who are we?

### Vinoth Kumar
Studied electrical engineering and did his MBA in HRM, and worked as a corporate employee with Standard Chartered Bank, Zoho & Groupon. 
Then, one day, he left all that to turn to farming! Yes, you read that right. 
Iâ€™ve taken farming as lifestyle rather than a profession. My Moto is to bring as many people as I can, back to farming.

Not everyone's turning point in life starts with turtles. I am lucky to be among that clan.I work as a volunteer for SSTCN to conserve turtles in coast of Chennai. Have worked with Paperman a recycling startup. At present working as Project consultant for Bhumi a NGO providing supplementary education for underprivileged kids . Backpacking happened between all this. To travel for a cause, to travel to document the practice of sustainable agriculture and to promote it across South East Asia.
